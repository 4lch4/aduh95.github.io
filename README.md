### Purpose

The aim of this to project is to build from scratch a software engine generating
a multilingual Résumé, to put into practice my knowledge of web development. You
can see the HTML version on [https://aduh95.github.io/].

Please note I do not wish you to change my work to adapt it for your own
curriculum vitae, but you are welcome to read the source code to help you
build your own.

### Run on your own environment

First, you have to ensure you these dependencies installed and available on your path:

* [PHP](php.net)
* [Yarn](yarnpkg.com)
* [Typings](https://github.com/typings/typings)
* [Composer](getcomposer.org)
* [Gulp](gulpjs.com)

I also suggest you to have the Livereload browser extension:

* for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei)
* for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/livereload/)
* ...

Then you can proceed to the installation:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `composer create-project` in the project directory
3. It's done!

Now, you just have to type `gulp` in the project directory to have your PHP server up and running.
